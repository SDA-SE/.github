## Moin Moin! 👋 👋🏿 👋🏻 👋🏽

![Our SDA SE office](./profile/img/Banner_sdase.jpg?raw=true)

Founded to digitalize the insurance industry and beyond that!  
We do that with a user centered approach and a platform featuring "all" the services you need to build these solutions.



### 🧑‍💻 How do we develop?
We believe in quality, standards and modern architectures powered with and by open source software. We love 
❤️ microservices and have first dates with microfrontends. With [sda-dropwizard-commons](https://github.com/SDA-SE/sda-dropwizard-commons) and [sda-spring-boot-commons](https://github.com/SDA-SE/sda-spring-boot-commons) we published toolsets for building microservices and are actively contributing to [Backstage by spotify](https://github.com/backstage/backstage). We built the [MongoDB Operator](https://github.com/SDA-SE/mongodb-operator) to [simplify deployments](https://medium.com/sda-se/kubernetes-operator-to-the-rescue-how-our-own-mongodb-operator-improved-our-deployments-6d5ba3324abc) in Kubernetes.

### 🫀 Our Culture
Be an active part of the team and contribute your ideas & opinions. Our team language is english and we love hiring people with diverse backgrounds.
We value humanity, open feedback culture, trust, respect and appreciation.   

### 🗞️ Our dev blog
We like best practices and also try (hard) to "regularly" post about some technical challenges we have solved. Get a first [glympse @ medium](https://medium.com/sda-se).
