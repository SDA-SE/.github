## Moin Moin! 👋 👋🏿 👋🏻 👋🏽

![Our SDA SE office](./img/Banner_sdase.jpg)

Founded to digitalize the insurance industry and beyond that! <br/> We do that with a user centered approach and a platform featuring "all" the services you need to build these solutions.



### 🧑‍💻 How do we develop?
We believe in quality, standards and modern architectures powered with and by open source software. We love 
❤️ microservices and have first dates with microfrontends. With [sda-dropwizard-commons](https://github.com/SDA-SE/sda-dropwizard-commons) we published a toolset for building microservices and are actively contributing to [Backstage by spotify](https://github.com/backstage/backstage).
<br/>
